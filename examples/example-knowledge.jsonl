Before that, she built the real-time analytics platform at DataFlow Inc.","confidence":"verified","source":"resume_2026.pdf","tags":["career","overview","verified"]}
{"id":"rag-2026-02-26-008","type":"qa_pair","topic":"skills","project":"Career","question":"What makes Jane different from other engineers?","answer":"Jane combines deep technical expertise in distributed systems with strong leadership skills. She's known for taking complex infrastructure problems — like migrating 50 services to Kubernetes or building real-time analytics at scale — and breaking them into manageable phases that teams can execute without burning out. She leads by building working prototypes that demonstrate the path forward, rather than writing lengthy design docs that nobody reads.","confidence":"verified","source":"interview_session_1","tags":["differentiation","leadership","value_proposition","verified"]}
{"id":"rag-2026-02-26-009","type":"narrative","topic":"career_history","project":"AcmeCorp","title":"The Kubernetes Migration: How Jane Moved 50 Services Without Downtime","content":"The Kubernetes migration at Acme Corp started as a cost-reduction initiative — infrastructure spend was growing faster than revenue. But Jane saw an opportunity to modernize the entire deployment pipeline. The hardest part wasn't the technical migration — it was getting 8 teams to agree on a shared deployment pipeline. Each team had their own deploy scripts, monitoring setup, and on-call processes. Jane's approach: build a prototype with one willing team, demonstrate the results (70% faster deploys, better observability), then let other teams adopt voluntarily. Within 3 months, every team had migrated. The 40% cost reduction was almost a side effect — the real win was deployment frequency going from weekly to multiple times per day.","confidence":"verified","source":"interview_session_1","tags":["acme_corp","kubernetes","leadership","migration","narrative","verified"]}
{"id":"rag-2026-02-26-010","type":"narrative","topic":"about","project":"Career","title":"Jane's Origin Story: From Physics to Platform Engineering","content":"Jane's path to engineering started in a physics lab. During her PhD research, she kept hitting the same problem: the data pipelines were too slow to process experimental results before the next run started. Instead of waiting for the university's IT team, she built her own. That pipeline — cobbled together from scripts and spare servers — processed data 10x faster than the official system. When she realized she was more excited about the pipeline than the physics, she dropped out of the PhD program and joined a startup. Fifteen years later, she's still solving the same fundamental problem: how do you move data from where it is to where it needs to be, fast enough to matter?","confidence":"verified","source":"interview_session_1","tags":["about","career","narrative","origin_story","verified"]}
{"id":"rag-2026-02-26-011","type":"technical","topic":"project_analytics","project":"DataFlow","title":"Real-Time Analytics Platform Architecture","content":"The analytics platform at DataFlow uses Apache Kafka for event ingestion (handling 2M+ events/day), Apache Flink for stream processing with exactly-once semantics, and ClickHouse for analytics storage. The architecture supports sub-second query latency on datasets up to 6 months deep. Key design decision: using Flink over Spark Streaming because the team needed true event-time processing with watermarks for handling late-arriving data from mobile clients. The system runs on Kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaling based on Kafka consumer lag.","confidence":"verified","source":"interview_session_2","tags":["analytics","architecture","clickhouse","flink","kafka","technical","verified"]}
{"id":"rag-2026-02-26-012","type":"technical","topic":"project_migration","project":"AcmeCorp","title":"Kubernetes Migration Strategy: The Strangler Fig Pattern","content":"Jane used the strangler fig pattern to migrate Acme's 50 services to Kubernetes without any production downtime. Each service was deployed alongside its EC2 counterpart, with traffic gradually shifted using weighted routing in the load balancer. Services were migrated in dependency order — starting with leaf services that had no downstream dependencies, then working inward. The migration included standardizing on Helm charts, implementing GitOps with ArgoCD, and building a shared observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger). Total migration time: 8 months for 50 services with zero customer-facing incidents.","confidence":"verified","source":"interview_session_2","tags":["acme_corp","argocd","gitops","kubernetes","migration","strangler_fig","technical","verified"]}
{"id":"rag-2026-02-26-013","type":"qa_pair","topic":"services","project":"Consulting","question":"Does Jane do consulting work?","answer":"Jane offers focused consulting engagements for teams tackling infrastructure modernization challenges. Her typical engagement is a 2-4 week architecture review and migration planning sprint, where she assesses the current state, designs a migration strategy, and works with the team through the first phase of implementation. She's selective about engagements — she works best with mid-size engineering teams (20-80 engineers) who have real scale challenges, not teams looking for general engineering advice.","confidence":"verified","source":"services_page.md","tags":["consulting","icp","services","verified"]}

{"id":"rag-2026-02-26-016","type":"narrative","topic":"skills","project":"Career","title":"How Jane Approaches Technical Leadership","content":"Jane describes her leadership style as 'prototype-driven.' Instead of writing lengthy design documents and scheduling review meetings, she builds a working prototype that demonstrates the approach. At Acme Corp, when she proposed the Kubernetes migration, she didn't start with a presentation — she migrated one service over a weekend and showed the team the before-and-after metrics on Monday. 'People argue with slides. They don't argue with graphs that show 70% faster deploys.' This approach extends to her team management: she pairs with engineers on the hardest problems rather than delegating from a distance, because she believes you can't lead a technical team effectively if you've lost touch with the actual work.","confidence":"verified","source":"interview_session_1","tags":["leadership","methodology","narrative","prototyping","verified"]}
{"id":"rag-2026-02-26-017","type":"qa_pair","topic":"about","project":"Career","question":"What does Jane care about beyond engineering?","answer":"Jane is passionate about making engineering teams sustainable — she's vocal about the damage that crunch culture and burnout do to both people and code quality. She mentors early-career engineers through a local meetup group and writes occasionally about infrastructure engineering on her blog. Outside of tech, she's an amateur trail runner and terrible but enthusiastic gardener.","confidence":"verified","source":"interview_session_3","tags":["about","mentoring","personal","sustainability","values","verified"]}
